# Club-1968

This is my first project that I created while studying Front-End web development at IT-HÃ¶gskolan in Gothenburg, Sweden. It was made for the course in HTML5 and CSS3.

It's a website made for a Swedish hockey support club. Specifically for Kalmar HC's support club, which is called "Club 1968".

One of the main criterias for the project was to make a responsive website, so that it works on most platforms.

None of the pictures used on this website are mine. They are all borrowed from different sources, mostly from Kalmar HC's own Facebook page as well as Club 1968's Facebook page. Many of these pictures are captured by Tove Dolff.

I only use these picture for educational purposes.

The project contains an easter-egg (that's totally not out of date), see if you can find it :))
